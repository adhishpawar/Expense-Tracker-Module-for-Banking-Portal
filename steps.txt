Great! Since you are focusing on Spring Boot with Hibernate, Spring Security, REST API, and Spring Data JPA, I'll structure the project in a scalable microservices-friendly manner with modular design.

Step 1: Define the Project Structure
Since we are designing an Expense Tracker as an extension to the Bank Management App, we should follow a modular and scalable architecture:

📂 Expense-Tracker (Root Project)
┣ 📂 backend (Spring Boot Application)
┃ ┣ 📂 src/main/java/com/expense/tracker
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 config → (Security & CORS Config)
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 controller → (REST APIs)
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 dto → (Data Transfer Objects)
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 entity → (JPA Entities)
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 repository → (Spring Data JPA Repos)
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 service → (Business Logic)
┃ ┃ ┗ 📂 exception → (Custom Exceptions)
┃ ┣ 📂 resources/application.yml
┃ ┗ 📜 pom.xml (Dependencies)
┣ 📂 frontend (React App - To be added later)
┣ 📂 docker (For Microservices Deployment)
┣ 📂 k8s (Kubernetes Deployment Files)
┗ 📜 README.md

Step 2: Define the Modules and Functionalities
Each module should handle a specific concern to ensure scalability and microservices compatibility.

1️⃣ User Management Module
🔹 Features:
✅ User Registration & Login
✅ Role-Based Access Control (Admin/User)
✅ JWT Authentication & Spring Security

2️⃣ Expense Management Module
🔹 Features:
✅ CRUD Operations for Expenses
✅ Categorizing Expenses (Food, Travel, Rent, etc.)
✅ Budget Allocation & Tracking

3️⃣ Budget & Notifications Module
🔹 Features:
✅ Set Monthly Budget Per Category
✅ Send Email Alerts on Overspending
✅ Generate Monthly/Annual Reports

Step 3: Implementing Spring Boot Modules
Here’s how you can proceed step by step:

1️⃣ Setting Up Spring Boot Project
Create a new Spring Boot Project using Spring Initializr:
Dependencies:
✅ Spring Web (For REST APIs)
✅ Spring Boot Security (For Authentication)
✅ Spring Data JPA (For ORM)
✅ Hibernate (For Database Handling)
✅ Java Mail Sender (For Email Notifications)
✅ Lombok (For Boilerplate Reduction)
✅ MySQL/PostgreSQL (For Database)
2️⃣ Define JPA Entities
We'll define our User, Expense, and Budget entities in the entity package.

Example: User.java

java
Copy
Edit
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(unique = true, nullable = false)
    private String email;

    private String password;
    private String role; // USER, ADMIN

    // Getters & Setters
}
3️⃣ Implement Authentication with Spring Security & JWT
Configure Spring Security for Role-Based Authentication.
Generate JWT Tokens for secure API access.
Implement Login & Registration APIs.
4️⃣ Develop REST APIs for Expenses
Controller Layer: Manages HTTP Requests.
Service Layer: Business Logic.
Repository Layer: Handles Database Operations.
Example: ExpenseController.java

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/expenses")
public class ExpenseController {

    @Autowired
    private ExpenseService expenseService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Expense> addExpense(@RequestBody Expense expense) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(expenseService.addExpense(expense));
    }

    @GetMapping("/{userId}")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Expense>> getExpenses(@PathVariable Long userId) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(expenseService.getUserExpenses(userId));
    }
}
5️⃣ Implement Email Notifications for Overspending
Use Java Mail Sender to send alerts when the user exceeds their budget.

6️⃣ Dockerize the Application for Microservices Deployment
Create a Dockerfile for the backend.
Deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Next Steps
✅ Start with Spring Boot Authentication (JWT, Spring Security).
✅ Implement CRUD APIs for Expenses.
✅ Add Budget Tracking & Alerts.
✅ Integrate React.js Frontend.
